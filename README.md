# The <span class=sans-serif>iconfonts</span> package

## Up-to-date LuaLaTeX support for _Font Awesome Free_ and _Academicons_


### Introduction

There already exist several packages on CTAN that provide access to
the _Font Awesome Free_ and _Academicons_ icon fonts, but these have
all become outdated and are missing many icons from newer versions
of those fonts. The <span class="sans-serif">iconfonts</span> package
attempts to deal with the update problem by building the LaTeX support
dynamically from data in the fonts themselves; updating the package
is then as simple as replacing the font files with newer ones.
The drawback of this approach is that the package only works with LuaLaTeX.
